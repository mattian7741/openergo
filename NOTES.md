To add a username and password to the RabbitMQ connection string in Kombu, you can use the following format:

```python
amqp://username:password@hostname:port/virtual_host
```

Here’s a breakdown of each part:

- `username`: The RabbitMQ username (default is often `guest`).
- `password`: The RabbitMQ password (default is often `guest`).
- `hostname`: The hostname or IP address where RabbitMQ is running (e.g., `localhost`).
- `port`: The port on which RabbitMQ is listening (default is `5672` for AMQP).
- `virtual_host`: The virtual host to connect to (default is usually `/`).

### Example

If your RabbitMQ server is running locally, with the default port and virtual host, and you’re using `guest` as both username and password, your connection string would look like this:

```python
connection = Connection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//")
```

If RabbitMQ is configured with custom credentials, replace `guest:guest` and other parts as needed. For example:

```python
connection = Connection("amqp://myuser:mypassword@myhost:5672/myvhost")
```

### Updated `AmqpCLI` with Authentication

Here’s how to integrate this into the `AmqpCLI` class:

```python
from kombu import Connection, Exchange, Queue

class AmqpCLI(OpenergoCLI):
    def handle(self):
        print("Handling amqp protocol")
        print("Config:", self.config)

        queue_name = f"q-{self.config.get('name')}"
        exchange_name = "openergo"
        routing_key = self.config["output_keys"][0]

        # Set up Kombu connection with authentication details
        connection_url = "amqp://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5672//"  # Replace with actual credentials
        with Connection(connection_url) as conn:
            exchange = Exchange(exchange_name, type="topic", durable=True)
            queue = Queue(queue_name, exchange, routing_key=queue_name, durable=True)

            with conn.Consumer(queue, callbacks=[self.process_message], accept=["json"]) as consumer:
                conn.drain_events(timeout=5)

    def process_message(self, body, message):
        modified_payload = {f"{key}_": value for key, value in body.items()}
        print("Modified payload:", modified_payload)

        with Connection("amqp://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5672//") as conn:
            exchange = Exchange("openergo", type="topic", durable=True)
            producer = conn.Producer(serializer="json")
            producer.publish(
                modified_payload,
                exchange=exchange,
                routing_key=self.config["output_keys"][0],
                declare=[exchange],
                retry=True
            )
            print("Published modified message to exchange 'openergo'.")
        message.ack()
```

### Summary

- Use the format `amqp://username:password@hostname:port/virtual_host`.
- Update `myuser`, `mypassword`, `localhost`, `5672`, and `virtual_host` as needed based on your RabbitMQ server configuration.
- Ensure that the username and password you use have permissions for the specified virtual host in RabbitMQ.

This configuration should allow Kombu to connect to RabbitMQ using the specified credentials.
